# RedPlanetVWE-GZDoom-Project
A (crazy) attempt to recreate Red Planet in GZDoom, with no real focus at the moment. Gonna be SLOW at first.

## The first objectives
Make the Flea hovercraft. The fastest of the ships that I know of, but one sneeze is all it takes to send you back to respawn<br>
Make a map that compliments the hovercrafts. Doesn't have to be Kiwi's Karma or Shroom's Lair, but it will have lanes, doors and score regions<br>
Figure out how to score based on speed and score region entries<br>

## Down the line
Post to ZDoom forum, get criticism<br>
Improve until satisfied (or until there's a bug discovered)<br>

## Potentials
Zandronum version for proper multiplayer chaos (WILL include Martian Football mode, just isn't the same without it)<br>
New maps WILL have to be made, since my GZDoom project will use a fair amount of slopes, which only GZDoom can do.<br>
