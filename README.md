# RedPlanetVWE-GZDoom-Project
A (crazy) attempt to recreate Red Planet in GZDoom, with no real focus at the moment. Gonna be SLOW at first.

## What I'm busy with in this project
1. Dropping reliance on Doom/Doom 2 textures.
2. Working on the door design specific to Red Planet, as well as timing them in a way that's faithful to Red Planet in general.
3. Getting references for the Bug Class VTV to self model it.<br>
Objectives list will be here <a href="https://github.com/AceSoren/RedPlanetVWE-GZDoom-Project">Objectives</a>

## The first MAJOR objectives
Make the Flea hovercraft. The fastest of the ships that I know of, but one sneeze is all it takes to send you back to respawn<br>
Make a map that compliments the hovercrafts. Doesn't have to be Kiwi's Karma or Shroom's Lair, but it will have lanes, doors and score regions<br>
Figure out how to score based on speed and score region entries<br>

## Down the line
Post to ZDoom forum, get criticism<br>
Improve until satisfied (or until there's a bug discovered)<br>

## Correction about Zandronum plans
ZikShadow has given me word that GZDoom multiplayer is indeed possible. Thanks to this knowledge I am COMPLETELY abandoning my plans for Zandronum since it's quite limited for my purpose anyways.
