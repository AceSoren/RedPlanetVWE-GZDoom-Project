# RedPlanetVWE-GZDoom-Project
A (crazy) attempt to recreate Red Planet in GZDoom, with no real focus at the moment. Gonna be SLOW at first.

## The first objectives
Make the Flea hovercraft. The fastest of the ships that I know of, but one sneeze is all it takes to send you back to respawn<br>
Make a map that compliments the hovercrafts. Doesn't have to be Kiwi's Karma or Shroom's Lair, but it will have lanes, doors and score regions<br>
Figure out how to score based on speed and score region entries<br>

## Down the line
Post to ZDoom forum, get criticism<br>
Improve until satisfied (or until there's a bug discovered)<br>

## Correction about Zandronum plans
ZikShadow has given me word that GZDoom multiplayer is indeed possible. Thanks to this knowledge I am COMPLETELY abandoning my plans for Zandronum since it's quite limited for my purpose anyways.
