# RedPlanetVWE-GZDoom-Project
A (crazy) attempt to recreate Red Planet in GZDoom, with no real focus at the moment. Gonna be SLOW at first.

## The first objectives
. Make the Flea hovercraft. The fastest of the ships that I know of, but one sneeze is all it takes to send you back to respawn
. Make a map that compliments the hovercrafts. Doesn't have to be Kiwi's Karma or Shroom's Lair, but it will have lanes, doors and score regions
. Figure out how to score based on speed and score region entries

## Down the line
. Post to ZDoom forum, get criticism
. Improve until satisfied (or until there's a bug discovered)

## Potentials
. Zandronum version for proper multiplayer chaos (WILL include Martian Football mode, just isn't the same without it)
